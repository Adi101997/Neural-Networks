- names.txt file contains lines of names, each line has at most most 11 characters. 
- There are 2000 lines of names.

# Steps for running the code
- Save all the files and the dataset in the same directory.
- Execute the Model.py, it will save the model.
- Execute Name_generation.py, it is used for generating new names.
